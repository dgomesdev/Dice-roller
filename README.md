# Dice-roller
Training project made for an online course of "Udacity". As this lesson was just an introduction to Android development, the original app simply showed a die in the screen that changed when a button was pressed. I've turned it on a "Guessing game". You can try to guess the number by typing a number and then pressing the button to "roll" the die. An alert dialog informs you if you correclty guessed the number or not. There's also a message if you type anything other than a number from 1 to 6.
